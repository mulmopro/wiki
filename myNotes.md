This notes serve as a quick reference for setting up and managing a Jekyll site using the Just the Docs theme.

- bundle install — installs the Ruby gems listed in `Gemfile` so the theme and its tooling are available locally
- bundle exec jekyll serve — builds the site and launches the live-reload server on `localhost:4000`
