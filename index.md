Welcome! This is a draft version of the Mulmo Wiki, for the research group Mulmopro at POLITO[^1]

Be advised that we are building this wiki as we go, so some pages will be incomplete or missing.

If you're visiting this pages now, you were probably referred to this wiki by a member of the Multiscale Modelling Group at Politecnico di Torino for a specific guide or tutorial, which should already be online.

Find them in the sidebar on the left, or by using the search bar at the top left.

I'm new here, what should I do?

[Where do I start?]

I just need [help] with something!
