This wiki is meant to be a repository of information regarding the activities of the Mulmopro research group.

Of course, all of this will be especially useful if you're just starting out, e.g. beginning your M.Sc. or Ph.D (or maybe you're considering starting). However, we hope that it will also be useful to more experienced researchers, as it will provide a quick reference for the tools and methods we use.

Maybe you are here because you have some doubts about a certain concept or you are unsure on how to perform a task. If you would prefer to read and explore on your own pace, search for or just pick a topic from the [[Help!|help page]].

If you have a quick or very specific question which you would like to discuss in a synchronous manner, just hop on our Discord server!

Also, although it was not its expressed purpose, traversing this wiki will give you an idea of what we are working on, which you may also find explained [here.](https://www.disat.polito.it/research/research_groups/musychen/multiscale_modelling_for_materials_science_and_process_engineering)
